Database Setup
-----
[x] Create a database named saga_movies_weekend
[x] Run the queries from database.sql on the saga_movies_weekend database.
[x] create the junction table between the movies and genres tables! 
    [x] It will be helpful to have some data for that junction table added.

Install Dependencies
-----
[x] npm install
[x] npm run server
[x] npm run client

Genres
-----
We've given you some starter genres in the database. 
Feel free to change or add some with Postico. 
[x] write out the whole GET flow to get the genres from your database to your client

Movies
-----
We've added some movie posters in the public/images folder, 
and the database is set up to use them.

Relationships
-----
Genres can be applied to many different movies. 
Movies can have multiple genres. 
This is Many-to-Many! Junction Table time!

FEATURE LIST
-----
[x] Take inventory of the existing code. 
Part of the work for setting up sagas has been done for you.

Home / List Page
-----
[x] This should display all of the movies in the movie database. 
[x] When a movie poster is clicked, a user should be brought to the /details view.

Details Page
-----
[ ] This should show all details including genres, for the selected movie.
Hint : You can make a GET request for a specific movie.
[x] 'Back to List' button, which brings the user to the Home Page
Base functionality does not require the movie details to load correctly after refresh of the browser.

Add Movie Page
-----
[ ] input field (for the movie title)
[ ] input field (for the movie poster image URL))

[ ] Save button

Hint: Look at the /api/movie POST route -- it's been made already
